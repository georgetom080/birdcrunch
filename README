BirdCrunch is a Perl utility to Analyse Bird Survey Data.

USAGE
-----
birdcrunch_lookup.xls and birdcrunch.pl forms the core of BirdCrunch Utility.

Copy the lookup file (birdcrunch_lookup.xls) and the script (birdcrunch.pl) in the same folder as the survey datasheet.
A sample survey sheet sample_datasheet.xls is provided in the git folder to reference, the survey datasheet should be in a format similar to this..
Open birdcrunch.pl and provide the survey name, datasheet filename, output filename, checklist filename (optional) analysis required, column numbers etc.
Run the script by 'perl birdcrunch.pl'. A new excel sheet with analysis is created in the same folder.

This folder also has the following miscellaneous utilities:
R_commands      : R commands to plot Bray-Curtis Similarity Dendrogram and NNDS
latlong.pl      : Perl code to convert various forms of GPS cord to dd.ddddd
replace_bird.pl : Perl code to replace (with correct nomenclature) the birdnames in a datasheet
compare_file.pl : Perl code to print the differential between two text files

Till an extensive README is prepared, please use the inline comments in the code for any more information :)
